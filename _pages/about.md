I am a fourth-year PhD Student in [Applied Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ace.illinois.edu/) and former Research Assistant in the [Center for Regional Economics and Policy](https://cepr.uai.cl/) at Universidad Adolfo Iba√±ez, Chile. My research interests are Development Economics, Regional Economics, and Economics of Education. My current research includes the role of peers on STEM college choice, the inter-regional migration of high school graduates, the effects of commuting on high school students' performance. I'm also Teaching and Research assistant at the Deparment of Agricultural and Consumer Economics (UIUC). Currently, I am working as RA in a project led by [Catalina Herrera-Almanza](https://catalinaherrera.weebly.com/) entitled "Social Networks and Women's Reproductive Outcomes: Evidence from a Randomized Experiment in Rural India".
