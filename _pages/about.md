About me:
======

I am a third-year PhD Student in Applied Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and former Research Assistant in the Center for Regional Economics and Policy at Universidad Adolfo Iba√±ez, Chile. My research interests are Development Economics, Regional Economics, and Economics of Education. I'm currently working on the analysis of inter-regional migration of high school graduates enrolled in higher education and the effects of commuting on students at high school. Also, I'm interested in how educational policies can affect fertility and infant health.
