I am PhD Student in [Applied Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ace.illinois.edu/) and former Research Assistant in the [Center for Regional Economics and Policy](https://cepr.uai.cl/) at Universidad Adolfo Iba√±ez, Chile. 

My research interests are Economics of Education,  Development Economics, and Regional Economics. My current research includes the role of peers on STEM college choices, the inter-regional migration of high school graduates, and the effects of commuting on high school students' performance. I'm also Teaching and Research assistant at the Deparment of Agricultural and Consumer Economics, at UIUC.
