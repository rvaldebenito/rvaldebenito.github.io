I am PhD Candidate in [Applied Economics at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign](https://ace.illinois.edu/). My research interests are Economics of Education, Gender, Development Economics, and Regional Economics. My current research includes the role of peers on STEM college choices, the inter-regional migration of high school graduates, and the effects of commuting on high school students' performance. I'm also Teaching and Research assistant at the Department of Agricultural and Consumer Economics. 

Prior to the PhD, I worked as a Research Assistant and Lecturer in the [Center for Regional Economics and Policy](https://cepr.uai.cl/) at Universidad Adolfo Iba√±ez, Chile. 

I'm on the 2023-2024 Job Market.
A draft of my job market paper will be available soon.
