I am an Assistant Professor in the Economics Department at Universidad Alberto Hurtado in Chile. I received my PhD in Applied Economics from the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. My research interests include the Economics of Education, Gender, Development Economics, and Regional Economics. My current research explores the role of peers in STEM college choices, the inter-regional migration of high school graduates, and the effects of environmental shocks on students' outcomes.
