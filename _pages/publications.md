**Peer Influence and College Major Choices in Male-Dominated Fields** [*job market paper*] <br/>


This paper investigates the effect of high school peers' choices on individuals' college major choices and explores whether the gender of the individuals and their peers is a relevant mediating factor on these effects. The empirical approach employs a regression discontinuity design, using student-level data from 2005 to 2019 from the centralized admission system of Chilean universities, where admission cutoffs are unpredictable and defined each year for each program-university combination. This paper analyzes peers exposed to different fields of study, such as comparing individuals whose peers were enrolled in male-dominated fields with a counterfactual option in a female-dominated one. The main finding shows a positive and significant impact of having a peer enrolled in a technology and engineering program on an applicant's enrollment and application to the same field only when the counterfactual alternative of the peers' admission is classified in the field of humanities, social sciences, and education. The results suggest substantial heterogeneity by gender. While male students exhibit a higher inclination towards technology and engineering fields when influenced by peers who have opted for male-dominated disciplines, female students are less likely to pursue that field when exposed to such peers.



**Migration of High School Graduates: How Relevant are the Degree Type and Field of Study?**
<br/>


The distribution of human capital plays a crucial role in shaping job opportunities, income levels, and the overall regional labor force in both the short and long term. This paper utilizes a unique dataset encompassing all Chilean students pursuing higher education from 2011 to 2017 to examine how geography, tertiary institution type, and field of study influence students' migration decisions. Our findings provide novel insights on the forces that shape the locational and programmatic decisions of students in higher education, and thus, the inter-regional distribution of human capital. Employing a gravity model approach, the findings emphasize that variations in migration patterns are influenced by factors such as the type of institution, field of study, and the regions of origin and destination for students. The estimates reveal disparities in how Vocational degrees attract students from their own regions and neighboring areas compared to universities offering Bachelor's Degrees. Furthermore, the analysis of different fields of study suggests that Education, Health, and Technology and Engineering tend to attract students from their local communities, although the degree of heterogeneity across fields is less pronounced. The results also indicate an inter-regional polarization in educational resources, with the capital region attracting a disproportionately higher number of students from other regions.
