Job Market Paper: Peer Influence and College Major Choices: Gender Disparities in Technology and Engineering Fields (Draft Available Soon)
======

 The lack of female graduates in fields such as technology and engineering is an important issue in most countries. Although women's educational attainment has increased over the last decades, there are substantial gender differences in the college major choice. In shaping those decisions, high school peers represent a central aspect of teenagers' social environment with the potential to affect individual choices. This paper investigates the relationship between high school peers' and individuals' college major choices, and whether female students are more likely, relative to male students, to follow older female peers when they enroll in male-dominated fields. Using student-level data from 2007 to 2019 from the centralized admission system of Chilean universities, this paper examines the causal impact of older high school peers' college enrollment  on younger students' choices, in the context of a regression discontinuity design. The results show a positive and significant impact of having a peer enrolled in a technology and engineering program on applicant's enrollment and application to the same field, only when the counterfactual alternative of the peers' admission is classified in the field of humanities, social sciences, and education. In contrast, when peers are at the margins of technology and engineering versus health, applicants are on average less likely to apply and enroll in the male-dominated field. 


Working Paper: Migration Decisions for Tertiary Education: How Far Are Chilean Students Willing to Go?
======

The human capital distribution plays an important role in the geography of jobs, incomes, as well as the short- and long-run regional labor force. Using a novel dataset on the universe of Chilean students pursuing higher education over 2011--2017, this paper assesses the roles of geography, tertiary institution type, and field of study in determining students' migration decisions. Using a gravity model approach, the main results highlight how differences in the migration flows are due to the type of institution and field of study chosen, and the region of origin and destination of the migration flows. Specifically, the estimations indicate significant differences in the degree that technical/vocational oriented institutions attract students from their own and neighboring regions compared to universities. Field of study comparisons suggest that the Education field mostly attracts students from the local community. The results also speak to inter-regional polarization in educational resources, as the largest region attracts a disproportionate number of students from other regions.
